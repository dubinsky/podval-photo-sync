What is this?
=============

This is a simple way to synchronize a folder hierarchy full of photos,
some of which are marked for publication, between a local disk and a
photo sharing service.

What services are supported?
============================

Picasa Web Albums.

The first service to be supported was Zenfolio, but I do not have a Zenfolio
account any longer (see [this post](http://blog.dub.podval.org/) for historical
background).

One of the goals of the design was to make adding more services easy: service
interfaces are general enough and at the same time allow quirks of specific
services to be accommodated.
